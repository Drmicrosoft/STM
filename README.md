# STM
Software that make Machines

The main idea is 
# make a software that generate cnc machines like 3Dprinters , Laser Cutters , CNC Milling and Any other Purpose using Parametric Design on Openscad 
Through Equations that will generate the whole files need to be cutted on Machines to make it easily to make your own customized macine body . 

# So why Openscad ? 

Because Openscad is like a text Based CAD software that used to generate DXF Files and STL Files and If I liked to change these parameters I can Change it using another GUI that will change the generated text that will run on openscad  which is better than make a DXF and STL generator .
